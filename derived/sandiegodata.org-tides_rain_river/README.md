# Combined Water Project Datasets

This package combines three other datasets for use in the water quality data
ptoject:

    * waterservices.usgs.gov-stream_discharge-fashion_valley_sd
    * tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov-water_levels-la_jolla#water_levels
    * noaa.gov-localclimate-200808_201807-san#lcd-san
	* noaa.gov-daily_summary-1998e-san#daily_summary_san

The resulting dataset has daily values for rainfall, flow rate for the San
Diego river, and the max and min tide level at La Jolla.


See the [EDA
Notebook](https://github.com/san-diego-water-quality/water-datasets/blob/master/derived/sandiegodata.org-tides_rain_river/notebooks/eda-tides_river_rain.ipynb) for details of the structure of the data, in particular, the time coverage in the Nulls section.
