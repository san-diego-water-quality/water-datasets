The USNG grid squares nearly always have more than 5 points. ( a square polygon
has a minimum of 5 points, since the end must finish at the start) Many of the
squares have 10 or 12 points, and they seem to be unecessary. So, this dataset
is simiplified with the polygons limited to 5 points. This simplification
results in the same number of dataset rows, but reduces the file size by about
42%.
