# San Diego Beachwatch Data

The Beachwatch data set has four bacteria measurements from 172 stations on the
coast of San Diego county, from July 1998 to Decenber 2013. The four
measurements are:

* Coliform, Total      66992
* Coliform, Fecal      65827
* Enterococcus         65010
* E. coli               4428

There are two units for the measurements: 

* MPN/100 mL: "Most Probable Number"
* cfu/100mL: "Colony forming units". Number of viable bacteria, excluding the dead ones. 

From [Cascade Analytical](http://www.cascadeanalytical.com/resources-downloads/faqs):

    What does CFU and MPN mean? A: CFU stands for 'Colony Forming Units' and
    refers to the number of viable bacterial cells in a sample per unit of
    volume. For example: 50 CFU/100 mL means 50 Colony Forming Units per 100 mL
    of sample. It is different from the direct microscopic counts that include
    both dead and living cells.

    MPN stands for 'Most Probable Number' and refers to a method that uses
    dilution cultures and a probability calculation to determine the
    approximate number of viable cells in a given volume of sample. It is
    useful when samples contain too few organisms for agar plates to be used or
    when organisms will not grow on agar. For example: 50 MPN/100 mL means that
    the Most Probable Number of viable cells in 100 mL of sample is 50.

I haven't found traditional data dictionary documentation, [but there are
controlled vocabulary lists](http://ceden.org/CEDEN_checker/Checker/LookUpLists.php) online for data submitters, which explain a lot of
the columns.
